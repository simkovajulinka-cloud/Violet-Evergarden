	<p>After the war there were many people who couldn’t write. Since the government wasnt addressing those needs. Hodgins thought it would be a great opportunity to create such company to fulfill those needs. To accomplish that he bought a three story old house and renovated it eventually quite a few people started to work there despite it being fairly new. The company is quite well known around the country and even beyond the borders<p>
