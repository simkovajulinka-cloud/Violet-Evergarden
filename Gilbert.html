He has a scar on his left cheek and one just above his left eye. He has short, slicked-back hair with several locks falling freely and framing his face. <br>
He looks very similar to his late father, as they are both considered attractive, but have a "stodgy look" to their face.

His uniform consists of a purplish-black outfit paired with burgundy linen shoulder pads and a decorative accordion-pleated cloth glistening around his hips and buttoned up to his neck.
